# Quantitative analysis of probe design strategies for FISH 
## Research Internship, AG Leonhardt, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München
- Worked on quantitatively analyzing the differences in properties between oligonucleotide probes generated by webtool PaintSHOP compared to custom pipeline Altius, against three target regions in an in-vitro model of a subgroup of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) harboring a chromosomal translocation between chromosome 3 and 8 in K562 cells. 
- Performed fluorescence in situ hybridization followed by spinning disk confocal microscopy.
- Performed background correction, image segmentation, and maximum intensity Z-projection on the microscopy images to detect and count the fluorescent spots. 
- Packages/Libraries used: Model and structure_probabilty from NUPACK, Bio.SeqUtils from Biopython, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, glob, skimage, scipy, nd2reader.
